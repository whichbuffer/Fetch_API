## Fetch API
Fetch API is a promise-based JS API, used for making asynchronous HTTP requests in a browser similar to XMLHttpRequest. It's standardized and supported by all modern browsers, except for IE.
In case IE needs to be covered as well, then there's a polyfill released by Github.

You can find the full documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

## UseState
UseState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. It allows us to use the same capabilities that this.state provides in a class.

Full documentation is available at this [link](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

## UseEffect
It executes functions after the component gets rendered.
We can think of UseEffect as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount combined together.
